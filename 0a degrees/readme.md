Code almost ran without exceptions the first time I tried to run it, except for 2 minor data type / syntax errors that were easily fixed.

Later realised I neglected to skip visited neighours. Also easily fixed with one statement.

Cases with no connection:

• Rene Van Sambeek - Brahma Kumbhar

Searched through around 300k persons, frontier had max size of around 155k persons. Code ran for <30 minutes. I used a Set() to track visited nodes (which should be much faster performance than using List()).

• Emma Watson - Marilyn Monroe

Searched through 377k persons, frontier had max size of around 157k persons. Code ran for 21 minutes.
