I skipped this optional step:

• If you would like, you may find that your algorithm is more efficient if you interleave search with inference (as by maintaining arc consistency every time you make a new assignment). You are not required to do this, but you are permitted to, so long as your function still produces correct results. (It is for this reason that the ac3 function allows an arcs argument, in case you’d like to start with a different queue of arcs.)
